The complete PHProjekt Client is based on dojo Version 1.02

For the PHProjekt specific dojo classes we use the Namespace phpr. Those classes can be found at htdocs/scripts/phpr

The dojo Client and the custom Class phpr.Main are loaded in the /application/Default/view/index.phtml file.
The phpr.Main class is located in htdocs/scripts/phpr/Main.js and is responsible for loading all required modules
and classes.

The Default methods for displaying a default PHProjekt Module can be found in the phpr.Default widget.
In that widget the functionality for creating the general layout, the navigation, submodule navigation, tree, grid and
Detail view is provided.

All other module widgets inherit the basic functionality from the Default widget. Only special funtions for those 
widgets must be manually implemented.

For the Communication between the different components (e.g. tree/grid/detail view) and the modules we use 
the dojo's topic system. Dojo.publish calls any functions that are connected to the topic via dojo.subscribe,
passing to those subscribed functions arguments that are published.
That way the Components themselve don't need to know which other Components must be notified when changes occur.
Instead all Components just subscribe all topics which affect them.

    This is the <b>General Help of Administration module</b><br />

    This module is only accessible to users with Admin profile.<br />
    It is located at the top right global modules, the last one.<br />
    <br />
    Here, general settings of the site that affect all users or specific ones in case of User submodule, can be set and
    modified.<br />
    <br />
    It is formed by 5 tabs:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Module</b><br />
    This is the Module Designer, a very easy-to-use visual drag & drop interface to create modules or modify many
    existing ones.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Tab</b><br />
    Here additional tabs for modules can be created and modified.<br />
    <br />
    <b>User</b><br />
    To administer users of the system: their main info and settings.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Role</b><br />
    To edit roles; a role is a set of permissions for the Project-modules (non Global ones) that is assigned to

    <br />
    <b>General</b><br />

    <b>Module tab</b><br />
    <br />
    The Module Designer is a very easy-to-use visual drag & drop interface to create modules or modify the existing
    ones.<br />
    <br />
    Firstly you press the <b>add</b> button or select an existing module from the grid. Then the form shows
    the label and permits you to choose whether it is currently active or not (whether it is shown in the system).
    <br />
    Pressing the <b>Open Dialog</b> button a pop-up window appears with the designer itself.<br />
    <br />
    <b>The Module Designer interface</b><br />
    <br />
    It has 3 panels:<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The left fields panel:</b> here are all the field types; <i>text</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>time</i>,
            <i>datetime</i>, <i>select</i>, <i>checkbox</i>, <i>percentage</i>, <i>rating</i>, <i>textarea</i> and
            <i>upload</i>.<br />
            You can drag & drop fields to the right panel, that right panel is the tab of the module you are creating
            or modifying as it will be seen (but without buttons <b>Edit</b> and <b>Delete</b>).<br />
            The <b>Edit</b> button in the right side of the fields, permits modifying its data before adding them to
            the module tab (right panel) although it is also possible to drag and drop it first and then edit it
            pressing that button in the right panel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The right tabs panel:</b> this has the main tabs of the module as they are going to be seen when you
            open it outside the <b>Module Designer</b> (except for the Edit / Delete buttons). You add fields dragging
            and dropping them from the left panel, then pressing <b>Edit</b> button the edit panel is opened in the
            left bottom part of the window so that you can configure the field.<br />
            The fields can be reordered with drag & drop method and deleted from the tab dragging & dropping them back
            to the left panel or just pressing <b>Delete</b> button.<br />
            There are as many tabs in this panel as tabs are defined in module <b>Administration</b> submodule
            <b>Tab</b>.<br />
            You don't need to use all the tabs created. The tab will appear in the module only if there are fields
            inside it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The left bottom editing panel:</b> here, when it is pressed the <b>Edit</b> button of a field, a
            window appears to modify its values and parameters.<br />
            It has 4 tabs:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Databse:</b> to edit the data of the database.

                <li>
                    <b>Form:</b> to edit the data shown in the form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grid:</b> to edit whether the field is shown in the grid or not, and its position inside it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>General:</b> general parameters.

    <b>How to create a module, from zero</b><br />
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Assuming you are in the <b>Module</b> tab of <b>Administration</b> module, press <b>Add</b> button.
        </li>
        <li>
            An empty form appears. Write the name of the new module in the <b>Label</b> textbox.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the <b>Open Dialog</b> button. A big pop-up window containing the module designer appears.<br />
            You will see the two big panels, one at the left and one at the right, and an empty space in the left
            bottom where the field editing window eventually appears.<br />
            Inside the right panel (the module as it will be seen outside the designer) there is a Project select box.
            That field should exist for the module to work, it is the relation between the item and the projects, don't
            delete it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add to the right panel using drag & drop a field of your choice. If there is more than one tab in the right
            panel, you can select the tab you want previous to the drag & drop to set the field there. In both cases,
            after dropping it the editing window appears for you to configure the field.<br />
            Note: to drop the field, you have to position it with the mouse over a place where the floating box that
            you are dragging converts itself from reddish pink to green color; that color means that you are able to
            drop the field there, up or behind another field.
        </li>
        <li>
            Configure the field attending to each of the 4 tabs of the editing window as explained here above.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the steps 5 and 6 as many times as fields you want to add.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the fields in the right panel in the order you want using drag & drop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the <b>Close</b> button in the left bottom of the window.
        </li>
        <li>
            The pop-up window has been closed. Press <b>Save</b> and the module is finished. The saving act, for
            example when <i>creating</i> a module, creates the table in the database, saves the parameters and creates
            the structure of folders and files.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <b>Notes:</b><br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            After saving a new module, it is needed to refresh the page in the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            The module will be added the <b>Access</b>, <b>Notification</b> and <b>History</b> tabs.
        </li>
        <li>
            There could be dragged back right panel fields to the left panel. This is useful to take them back later
            to the right panel, or to move them to another right panel tab.

    <b>TAB tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This section permits modifying the tabs of the modules.<br />
    <br />
    Its purpose is just to manage how many user defined tabs could exist in the modules, and their names. For example,
    if there are 3 tabs: the default 'Basic Data' one plus two created by you, in the 'Module Designer' you can define
    which tabs to use in a specific module; you don't need to use all the tabs created. The tab will appear in the
    module only if when modifying it with the <b>Module Designer</b> you drop fields inside it.<br />
    E.g.: you can create an extra tab 'Geographic Info' and create a module with the <b>Module designer</b>.
    If you just drag & drop fields to the 'Basic Data' tab and nothing to the 'Geographic Info' tab, then the second
    tab won't be seen in the module.<br />

    <b>Role tab</b><br />

    This tab permits managing the Roles.<br />
    <br />
    A Role is a specific set of permissions for each module. That Role then is assigned to users of the Projects you
    want, so that he will have that rights. When you create or edit a Project, you can give every different user that
    Role inside Rol tab.<br />
    The final right for a specific user to work with an item is defined by the conjunction of the data defined both
    inside Role and Access tabs of Project module.<br />
    <br />
    By default, no Role is assigned to anybody, and the permission to access to a new project will be <b>Admin</b>
    access  for the creator and nothing for the rest.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Example</b>
    <br />
    You can create a Role called 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs'.<br />
    And set in that Role <i>Read</i> access to the <b>Todo</b> and <b>Note</b> modules.<br />
    Then you create a Project and assign the user 'john' the Role 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs', so when he enters the
    Project, the only thing he will be able to do apart from reading the main data of the Project itself is to read
    (but not modify) items of <b>Todo</b> and <b>Note</b> modules.<br />
    <br />

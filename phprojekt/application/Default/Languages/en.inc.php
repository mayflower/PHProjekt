    The rights are: Read, Write, Access, Create, Copy, Delete, Download and Admin.<br />
    The users that have access to this tab for a specific item, like the owner (creator) of it, can assign these rights
    to other users for this item.<br />
    <br />
    The users that appear in the select list of this tab, that are the ones you can assign rights to, are all the users
    that have access to the parent Project, except for the logged user who is seeing the tab. If you want an unlisted
    user to be listed in the select field, you have to give him/her access to all parent projects.<br />
    The aim of that tab is to select what users you want to give access to the item and what kind of access.<br />
    For example, you create an item and choose some users to give them 'Read' access and if you want you can choose
    another user and give him/her 'Write' access.<br />
    <br />
    The different permissions are:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Read</b>: see the item.<br />
    <b>Write</b>: modify the item.<br />
    <b>Access</b>: pass through the item (e.g.: see the sub projects but not to see the project itself).<br />
    <b>Create</b>: create sub items.<br />
    <b>Copy</b>: copy the item to create other one.<br />
    <b>Delete</b>: delete the item.<br />
    <b>Download</b>: download files (for example in the Filemanager module).<br />
    <b>Admin</b>: allows to do all, including editing the access of the item.<br />

    This tab makes possible to send an automatic email notification to all the users with read access to the current

<h3>The Tree</h3>
<p>
The tree is the main way to navigate around your projects in PHProjekt 6.
Inside the tree you can find all projects that you are currently allowed to see.
To get to the root node of the tree, just click the PHProjekt logo in the top left corner.
You can expand and collapse subprojects in the tree with the cross button on the left side of each label.

<h3>The Grid</h3>
<p>
The grid is a more sophisticated way to navigate the child projects of a selected project.</br>
Here you can see a summary of some of the data of each child project and edit the listed projects directly by double-clicking
on a given cell value.</br>
If you just do a single click on a grid row, the full featured project form will open and allow you to see all the values
of the selected project.</br>
On the left side of each row is a small checkbox which can be used to select multiple projects and delete or export them
together using the "with selected" dropdown menu at the bottom of the grid.</br>
If the selected project has no child projects yet and you have the permission to create subprojects, the grid will
only show you a message indicating that there are currently no subprojects and a button to create one.

Project modules are the core of the PHProjekt groupware.</br>
Each module is associated with a project.</br>
Modules contain all the functionality that you can use on a given project like
inputting form data, uploading files, creating helpdesk tickets, watching statistics and so on.</br>
You can manage the active modules of any project but the root project by selecting it in the tree and clicking on 
the "Basic Data" tab. This tab contains a section "Module" where you can enable or disable the installed modules for the
selected projects.</br>
It is possible to control the access to specific modules on a per user basis by creating appropriate roles in the
administration section of PHProjekt and assigning the role to the user.

<h3>Global Modules</h3>
<p>
Unlinke project modules, global modules are not bound to a specific project but only exist once for any given user.</br>
They are used for general tasks like timetracking, calendars, managing contacts, adjusting the user settings or,
if you are an administrator, changing global PHProjekt settings like adding users and roles, modifying
modules and changing the general company settings.</br>

<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>
Tags help you to easily find specific projects.</br>
In the forms in the project modules it is possible to enter a comma separated list of tags that are associated with each item.</br>
As you add tags to projects, they will appear in the tags box in the bottom left corner.</br>
When you click on one of the tag names in this box, PHProjekt will display a search window, listing all projects
with the specified tags, grouped by module.</br>
Using this feature it is very easy and fast to find projects that for example share a common topic.
